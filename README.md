# EEWS and EWBS Interface
This is the repository of the interface between the Earthquake Early Warning Systema and Emergency Warning Broadcast System. It is structured in three separate folders:
1. eews2ewbs interface which links both system through Active MQ.
2. Dashboard Delay for collecting data from log info of eews2ewbs system to create graphs in diferent time periods.
3. ewbsconsole that is the link between the interface and Red Terminal (it also contains the source code in C#)

Each folder contains its own Readme.md file on which it can be found further information like setup, configuration, and more.
